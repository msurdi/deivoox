# Deivoox

I love the [A Ciencia Cierta](https://www.cvradio.es/podcasts-a-ciencia-cierta/)
podcast, but the episodes are only available via [ivoox](https://www.ivoox.com),
which restricts which episodes you can listen to and/or the lenght of them if
you are not using their own App.

Given I use a different one (and I like it), I've created this quick'n dirty
script which will parse the list of episodes and create a custom feed containing
the full episodes list and at full length.

## Running this application

1. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
2. Start it with `npm start`
3. The feed will be available at `/feed.xml`
